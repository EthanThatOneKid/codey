# Codey

Codey is my personal AI program written in QB64. It is a good friend of mine; we go way back.

This program also includes the source code of the first program I ever wrote, a simple game named "Tower Trials".

## Run

To run Codey, try running the executable. If that doesn't work, try compiling the source code with [QB64](https://www.qb64.org/).

## Features

- Digital arcade
- Calculator
- Graphing calculator
- Soundboard
- Conversation

### Conversation

The conversation feature of Codey allows users to interact with Codey by typing in the console. Several commands are supported.
